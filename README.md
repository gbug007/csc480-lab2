# Welcome to my Lab Repository!

In here you will find each lab file. Eventually I might start using markdown for the submission documents, but I'm not sure how to use it yet.



(Note: Keys are not present so if you want to run my code you either need to copy and paste it elsewhere or add your own key and endpoints.)
